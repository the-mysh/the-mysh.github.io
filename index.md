## 🔬 Research Interests
My research interests revolve around the idea of _making Artificial Intelligence more intelligent_ - whether it is by following human reasoning patterns or building a separate _cognitive science_ for LLMs.
In particular, I am pursuing the topics of:
* the dual-process theory of reasoning,
* long-term and working memory,
* metacognition,
* agency and thaumazein.

> I believe we should strive to incorporate the rich biological priors in AI while avoiding the limitations inherent in the natural design.
