# Hi, I'm Dominika!

I am a first-year [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/research/phd-postdoc) PhD Student. I'm pursuing a double degree at  [Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal)](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en) and [University of Granada (Spain)](https://www.ugr.es/en), under the supervision of [professor Arlindo Oliveira](https://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/arlindo.oliveira/) and [professor Natalia Diaz-Rodriguez](https://sites.google.com/view/nataliadiaz). While our current work is fueled by a shared passion for AI, we are also connected by a common history: all three of us have, at different chapters of our careers, spent time working at [CERN](home.cern)!

## 🔬 Research Interests
My research interests revolve around the idea of _making Artificial Intelligence more intelligent_ - whether it is by following human reasoning patterns or building a separate _cognitive science_ for LLMs.
In particular, I am pursuing the topics of:
* the dual-process theory of reasoning,
* long-term and working memory,
* metacognition,
* agency and thaumazein.

> I believe we should strive to incorporate the rich biological priors in AI while avoiding the limitations inherent in the natural design.
